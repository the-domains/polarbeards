            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Polarbeards</h1><p>The start of Polar Beards technically goes back over two years ago, when we got tired of trying beard oils that didn’t work well enough for us. Our vision was to find the ultimate blend of oils, that manages to keep our beards nourished and moisturized, as well as fight the inevitable dryness of the skin underneath the beard. Other beard oils on the market just didn’t do the trick in extreme conditions, such as -30 Celsius winters in Lapland, when the air is very dry.

We experimented with over a hundred different blends and ratios until we were finally pleased with our product. The fact that we wanted to include only organic oils and stay away from nut derived oils, didn’t make the task any easier.

Because this started simply as a project to create the perfect beard oil for ourselves, instead of a commercial one, we never acquired big and heavy equipment for mass production. Our oils are still mixed in very small batches to ensure the exactness of the ratios and the overall quality of the product, and we intend to keep it that way.

Lastly, we tested our beard oil against the placebo effect by matching it up with over 30 of the most popular beard oils available on the market. You should understand that all beard oils strive to take care of your beard and the skin underneath it. Most of them do OK for a short period of time, a few could be described as good and some even make it worse.

We can honestly and proudly say we feel the Polar Beards Beard Oil knocked even the best and the priciest oils easily off the table. What we took into consideration was how fast it absorbs, the duration of the effect and obviously how well it works.

We managed to outperform every single beard oil we tested, in all of the categories.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ac7e18a5882b86e45ec44f6050a4d6db5f34fbae.png"></article>]]></description>
